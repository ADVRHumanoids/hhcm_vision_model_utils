# Training

Training part is done by adapting tutorials and repos around the web, so some additional files must be 
dowloaded as per instructions

## Training Non-YOLO models

Taken from https://github.com/pytorch/vision/tree/main

- Download files from https://github.com/pytorch/vision/tree/main/references/detection and put them in this folder, inside a "detection" folder. 
  They will be used by `TrainModel.py`

- Run `TrainModel.py`. Examples about how to run are given in TrainMain.py

## Training YOLOv5 models

Taken from https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5/

You can either follow the https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5/ tutorial (Training part)

OR, clone that repo somewhere and use the `TrainYolo.py`. Example about how to use the MainYolo are in `TrainMain.py`

## Training YOLOv11
*TODO*
